        <p>
          This Privacy Policy explains how Local Hours ("the App") handles your information.
          It applies to all versions of the App on macOS, iOS, and Android (including future releases).
        </p>

        <p>
          Local Hours is fully open source under the MIT license. The complete source code is available at
          <a href="https://github.com/gogrinimish/LocalHours">github.com/gogrinimish/LocalHours</a>,
          so you can verify every claim in this policy yourself.
        </p>

        <!-- 1 -->
        <h2>Your data stays on your devices</h2>

        <p>
          Local Hours is built from the ground up as a <strong>local-first</strong> app.
          All of your data — time entries, timesheets, configuration, and preferences — is stored
          as plain files in a folder on your device that you choose and control.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>We do not operate any servers.</strong>
          No data from the App is ever uploaded to, processed by, or stored on any server
          owned or controlled by Local Hours or its developer.
        </p>

        <!-- 2 -->
        <h2>Cloud sync is your choice</h2>

        <p>
          If you place your Local Hours data folder inside a cloud storage service — such as
          iCloud Drive, Google Drive, or OneDrive — that provider will sync the files according
          to its own terms and privacy policy. This is how companion apps on other devices
          (for example, the iOS app and the macOS app) can share the same data.
        </p>

        <p>
          Local Hours itself does not upload anything. The cloud sync is handled entirely by
          the storage provider you choose. If you keep your data folder on local disk only,
          nothing leaves your device.
        </p>

        <!-- 3 -->
        <h2>No accounts, no analytics, no tracking</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>The App does not require or support user accounts.</li>
          <li>The App does not collect analytics, usage statistics, or telemetry of any kind.</li>
          <li>The App does not contain advertising or ad-tracking frameworks.</li>
          <li>The App does not share data with any third party.</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- 4 -->
        <h2>Permissions the App may request</h2>

        <p>
          Depending on the platform, the App may ask for the following permissions.
          Each is used solely for the described purpose:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>File / folder access</strong> — to read and write your time entries and configuration in the folder you select.</li>
          <li><strong>Notifications</strong> — to send you reminders (for example, when it is time to submit your timesheet).</li>
          <li><strong>Widgets / home-screen extensions</strong> (iOS, Android) — to display your timer and quick controls.</li>
          <li><strong>App groups / shared containers</strong> (Apple platforms) — to let the main app and its widgets share data on the same device.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          You can revoke any permission at any time in your device settings. Some features
          may stop working if their required permission is removed.
        </p>

        <!-- 5 -->
        <h2>Emailing timesheets</h2>

        <p>
          When you generate a timesheet email, the App hands the content to your device's
          default email client (for example, Apple Mail or Gmail). The email is composed and
          sent by your email client, not by Local Hours. We never see or receive a copy of
          that email.
        </p>

        <!-- 6 -->
        <h2>App stores and platform services</h2>

        <p>
          Local Hours is distributed through the Apple App Store, and may in the future be
          distributed through Google Play or other stores. These platforms may independently
          collect crash reports, download statistics, or other information under their own
          privacy policies. We do not control that collection.
        </p>

        <p>
          We may see aggregated, anonymized data (such as download counts or crash-free
          percentages) through the store's developer dashboard. This data is provided by the
          platform, not collected by the App.
        </p>

        <!-- 7 -->
        <h2>Safe for all ages</h2>

        <p>
          Local Hours is a simple productivity tool that tracks working hours and generates
          timesheets. It does not contain objectionable content, social features, in-app
          purchases, or connections to third-party services. There is nothing in the App that
          would make it unsafe or inappropriate for users of any age.
        </p>

        <!-- 8 -->
        <h2>Deleting your data</h2>

        <p>
          Because all data lives in files you control, deleting your data is straightforward:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>Delete the data folder (and any cloud-synced copies) to remove all time entries and timesheets.</li>
          <li>Remove the App from your device to delete app preferences and cached state.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We do not retain any copy of your data, so there is nothing for us to delete on our end.
        </p>

        <!-- 9 -->
        <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>

        <p>
          If we update this Privacy Policy, we will revise the "Last updated" date at the top
          of this page. Because the App is open source, all changes to this policy are visible
          in the project's public commit history.
        </p>
